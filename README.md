**What is History?**

In its simplest understanding, history is a “branch of knowledge dealing with past events. A continuous, systematic narrative of past events as relating to a particular people, country, period, person, etc.” (History, 2018).  However, history can be much more complicated. Things like, multiple narratives, conflicting narratives, technology, and culture can all complicate how and what history is. 


**What does ‘digital history’ really mean?**

Digital history or digitizing history is the process of using technology to represent a historical narrative in the digital world. Digitizing history is often used as a method of story telling and usually focuses on a specific narrative. Using technology to tell this narrative offers a different and often more immersive experience to the people interacting with it. 


**What happens to history as it gets digitized?**

As history become digitized, it becomes more accessible to everyday people. You no longer need to travel or have special access to museum archives to see historical objects. With this increased accessibility, there is worry that the digital recreations will decrease the value of the original object. I do not believe this to be necessarily true because “even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in physical condition over the years as well as the various changes in its ownership” (Benjamin, 1968). I think that the most beneficial way for digitized history to exist, is for it to support the original object by either making the original more accessible or by creating a unique experience in relation to our interactions with the physical object. Digital history should enhance our cultural understanding and knowledge, similarly to Marshall McLuhan’s’ theory how technology affects culture (Papagiannis, 2011). 


**Introduction to the project:**

This portfolio will discuss the relationship between history and digitization. Specifically, how technology changes the way we understand and interact with history in relation to the course material in Critical Making in Digital History by Professor Shawn Graham. 
I wanted the digital project for the class to fit into a secondary personal project of mine; a family history archive. I felt that the process of digitizing my personal family history was relevant to the steps we were taking in learning about digital history in class. The parameters of the class project gave me the opportunity to experiment with different ways of digitization that could be useful to the archive I am building. The goal of the secondary project is to collect as much family history as possible, whether it be photographs, stories, or letters. To do this I am following a similar method as described in the ACCORD Project, by involving others or the “community” and fostering a sense of ownership over the material being collected (Maxwell, 2017). I want the archive to be sustainable and since I am unable to physically go and collect the material myself, I need to rely on others to both facilitate the collection and see its value by using the database.  


**About object:**

Dessert /tea earthenware ceramic plate with maroon /gold bands, center floral of pink roses, gold filigree, gilded and embossed edge made by Sovereign Potters Canada. Dated approximately 1940-1945.  The plate was chosen for this project because it has a deep personal history. The plate was first owned by Molly Ryan (Great Grandmother) -> Theresa Dobbin (Grand Mother) -> Ann Dobbin-Nolan (Mother) -> Meranda Nolan (Me). The plate was also made by a company (Sovereign Potters) with strong roots in Canadian history.

**Digitizing the object:**

To start the digitization process, I made a digital 3D model of the plate using the app, Trino (http://trn.io/n/nipnJ68Tl1/ ). In this case, the making of a 3D model did not greatly affect the narrative of the objects history. The model acts more in a preservation capacity than as a means of telling history. However, it does allow for viewers to interact with the object with out needing to be in the physical presence of the original object. The 3D model adds an extra element to the relationship between the viewer and the object that would otherwise be missing if they were simply looking at a 2D photograph. 


**Introducing new objects to add meaning / context to original object:**

It is not enough to have a free standing digital object, it needs context for it to relate to the historical narrative. For my object to contribute to the historical narrative I was trying to tell, I decided to add other digital content for my digital object to interact with.  

The other digital objects I chose where:

1.	Family Photograph (Ann, Grandmother, Mother, Wayne, Eileen, Cyril, at Christmas 1981 )

2.	Photograph of Saint Joseph’s Welcome Sign

Part 1 – Remixing: 
The next step was to remix the object with another digital object. For this, I chose to create a mosaic photograph of a family picture using the texture.jpeg image created during the process of making the 3D model. I decided to use this family photograph because it gives a visual image to the people behind the history of the plate, as three previous owners of the plate are depicted in the photograph.

This photo bashing approach was inspired by Tara Copplestones’ blog post “Making Things: Photobashing As Archaeological Remediation?” (2015). I appreciated her outlook on digital recordkeeping and her opposition to the rigidity of archaeologies focus on the representation of reality (Copplestone, 2015).  

Part 2 -Back to the Physical World (AR):
For the AR portion of this project I chose to use both location (Saint Joseph’s) and a photograph representing the location (Saint Joseph’s Welcome Sign) to give context to the object. By using AR and location I was able to create a virtual tour (using ARIS and Vuforia) of the place the original object was from. This “game” could also fit into a large scope of project by making a virtual tour of the whole town. While there may or may not be other artifacts added in the future, the focus for now is the plate (and by extension the welcome sign for context). In theory, someone would be able to walk around the town and be introduced to different artifacts, stories, photographs, history, etc., essentially acting as an AR version of the family archive. Bringing the object back into the real world allows for a more personal and immersive interaction. This type of digital history would be extremely useful for when the original object is not physically accessible, as it can still be seen and interacted with in a purposeful way. The plate can now seamlessly fit into the larger historical narrative.


**Conclusion:**

The use of technology to tell history has impacted the way we understand and interact with historical artifacts. Digitization changes the way we tell historical narratives by allowing us to link objects that may have never been shown together because of the issues faced when moving / displaying physical objects such as, conflicting ownership, physical location, size, and preservation needs. Digitization permits increased creativity when interacting with artifacts, since we can move and change the digital object without fear of destroying it. Digitization allows for exploration of different ways of telling historical narratives and lets these narratives be displayed together for a more complete perspective.
